# Hello Microverse Project

> This exercise is to practice the different techniques and information we have been studying today about GitHub, such as Linters, GitIgnore, Branches, and Code Review Requests.

## Built With

- CSS & HTML
- Github
- Linters

## Getting Started

In this project we created a repository and a branch on which we loaded html and css files, as well as Linters to evaluate the quality of our code. We also practiced how to use Git Ignore files to ignore certain files which we dont need to load into our Repository.
Finally, we push all of our commits to Github and make a Pull Request to the Main branch so it can ve reviewed and aproved for Merging.
